                  <h3 class="major">General Dentistry</h3>

                  <p>General dentistry involves the prevention, diagnosis and
                  treatment of a wide variety of conditions, disorders and
                  diseases affecting the teeth, gums and maxillofacial
                  (associated with the jaw and face) region of the body.</p>

                  <p>General dentists provide services related to the general
                  maintenance of oral hygiene and tooth health.</p>

                  <p>Ideally, dentistry is preventative. We recommend that you
                  visit your dentist regularly – at least once every six
                  months – to ensure proper oral hygiene and functionality.
                  Regular checkups and oral health maintenance prevent the
                  development of serious dental problems that can require
                  costly treatment. If you remain vigilant and visit your
                  dentist regularly, you can enjoy exceptional dental health.</p>

                  <h4>Gum Treatment (Cleaning and Scaling)</h4>

                  <p>Gingivitis is a chronic inflammation of the gum tissue
                  (gingiva). Typically associated with poor oral hygiene,
                  gingivitis is the early stage periodontitis. Many people are
                  not even be aware that they have gingivitis, because it is
                  usually not painful. Periodontitis is an inflammatory
                  condition affecting the tissues surrounding a tooth, and is
                  the leading cause of tooth loss. There are a number of
                  causes of gum disease, each of which can be corrected and
                  controlled.</p>
                  
                  <p>There are a number of treatments available for gum
                  disease sufferers, each of which varies depending on the
                  severity of the condition. In order to determine the
                  treatment modality that best meets your needs, your dentist
                  will evaluate the extent of the damage caused by gum disease
                  to develop a conservative initial plan. A dental hygiene
                  evaluation will determine if plaque (soft deposits on the
                  tooth) is being removed on a daily basis.</p>
                  
                  <p>Next, calculus (also known as tartar) must be removed
                  through a professional cleaning, and sometimes through the
                  additional procedures of deep scaling and root planing. A
                  local anesthetic may be administered during these
                  procedures. Your dentist may also administer antibiotics to
                  treat bacteria housed in the pocketed areas of the gum, and
                  recommend a medicated mouthwash to be used as a regular part
                  of your home regimen.</p>

                  <h3 class="major">Restorative Dentistry</h3>

                  <p>Restoration is a term used in dentistry to describe
                  restoring the function of the tooth by replacing missing or
                  damaged tooth structure. Restorations are classified as
                  either:</p>
                  
                  <dl>
                    <dt>Direct:</dt>
                    <dd>The restoration is fabricated, or made inside the
                    mouth, ie. composite or amalgam fillings.</dd>
                    <dt>Indirect:</dt>
                    <dd>The restoration is made outside of the mouth, ie.
                    dentures, crowns, bridges, implants, inlays, onlays.
                    Common materials used are acrylic, chrome, gold,
                    porcelain, and zirconia.</dd>
