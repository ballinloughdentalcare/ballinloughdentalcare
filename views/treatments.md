General Dentistry

General dentistry involves the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of conditions, disorders and diseases affecting the teeth, gums and maxillofacial (associated with the jaw and face) region of the body.

General dentists provide services related to the general maintenance of oral hygiene and tooth health.

Ideally, dentistry is preventative. We recommend that you visit your dentist regularly – at least once every six months – to ensure proper oral hygiene and functionality. Regular checkups and oral health maintenance prevent the development of serious dental problems that can require costly treatment. If you remain vigilant and visit your dentist regularly, you can enjoy exceptional dental health.

Cosmetic Dentistry

While traditional dentistry focuses on oral hygiene and preventing, diagnosing and treating oral disease, cosmetic dentistry focuses on improving the appearance of a person's teeth, mouth and smile. In other words general dentistry addresses dental problems that require necessary treatment, whereas cosmetic dentistry provides elective – or desired – treatments or services.

Cosmetic dentistry may also provide restorative benefits. For example, dental fillings are a common procedure used to treat decayed teeth. Previously, most dental fillings were composed primarily of gold, amalgam and other materials that left visible dark spots on the teeth.

Today, dental fillings may fall into the category of cosmetic dentistry, because you can select fillings made of porcelain or composite materials that closely match the colour of your teeth, thus maintaining the natural appearance of your teeth and smile. 

  Composite Bonding: Chipped, broken, discoloured or decayed teeth may be repaired or have their appearance corrected     using a procedure called composite bonding. A dental composite material with the look of enamel and dentin is applied   into the cavity or onto the surface of a tooth, where it is then sculpted into shape, contoured and hardened with a     high-intensity light. The result is a restoration that blends with the remainder of the surrounding tooth structure     and the rest of your natural teeth to create a healthy, bright smile.

  Teeth Whitening: Teeth whitening is perhaps the most commonly recommended cosmetic dentistry procedure. Teeth are       often stained from smoking, food, drink (coffee, tea or red wine) or poor oral hygiene. Bleaching the teeth can         enhance the appearance of your smile.

  Dental Veneers: Composite or porcelain laminates that are adhesively bonded to the surface of a tooth to correct and    repair chips and cracks will improve a worn appearance or severe tooth discolouration.
